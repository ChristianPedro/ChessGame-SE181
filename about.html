<h2>Chess 25 is an interactive web game where two people in remote locations can play a game of chess. Each player will take turns moving their chess pieces until one player wins. To win the game, a player must place the opponent's king in checkmate. A king is in checkmate if it is in check, the opponent's piece putting the king in check can not be captured, and the king cannot move outside the check position.
